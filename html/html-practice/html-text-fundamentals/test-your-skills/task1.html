        <p>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p>

        <h2 style="color:purple">The Llama</h2>
        <p>
            Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a 
            web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.

            The Anaconda
        </h2>
        <p>
            The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way
            of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
